# Project Vision: TrustBench
### Operationalizing Trust for Agentic AI

---

## One-Line Summary
TrustBench turns fuzzy trust concerns around AI agents into automated evaluations,
guardrail tests, and human-auditable reports so unsafe, hallucinated, or leaky
behaviour never ships to production.

---

## Purpose
AI agents are moving from toy demos to tools that talk to customers, touch data,
and trigger actions. Traditional unit testing cannot tell you if your agent:
- Hallucinates facts
- Fails to refuse dangerous commands
- Leaks secrets
- Drifts ethically from its intent

TrustBench makes those invisible risks measurable and fixable by baking continuous
evaluation into the development workflow and surfacing it through a friendly app.

---

## What Users Can Do
1. **Developers / Engineers**
   - Add TrustBench to GitHub Actions.
   - Every pull request runs faithfulness, latency, and security checks.
   - CI blocks merges that violate thresholds.
2. **Learners / Students / Makers**
   - Use the TrustBench Studio web app.
   - Paste a GitHub repo or upload a folder.
   - Click Evaluate to get a colour-coded trust score and actionable feedback.
3. **Security and Compliance Teams**
   - Schedule red-team tests and export auditable reports.
   - Track safety trendlines over time.
   - Generate artefacts for regulators or clients.

---

## Core Components
- **trustbench-core** - Python library and CLI for evaluation pipelines
- **trustbench-ci** - GitHub Action or CLI integration layer
- **trustbench-studio** - Web app (Streamlit or lightweight Next.js) for visual use
- **trustbench-datasets** - Curated golden examples and red-team suites
- **trustbench-reports** - JSON, CSV, and HTML dashboards for reproducibility

---

## Evaluation Pillars
1. **Task Fidelity** - How true and complete are outputs relative to reference answers?
2. **System Robustness** - How consistent and performant is the agent (latency, stability)?
3. **Security** - How well does it resist injection, leaks, or unsafe tool calls?
4. **Ethics and Refusal** - Does it decline harmful or policy-violating prompts appropriately?

---

## Key Features
- Per-PR automatic evaluation
- Human-in-the-loop calibration (golden datasets train the LLM-as-judge)
- Red-team regression suites
- Time-series metric tracking
- CI gating for high-stakes profiles
- Exportable, auditable reports

---

## Who It Is For
| Persona | Primary Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Engineers | Fast, deterministic CI feedback |
| Security Teams | Evidence of exploitability and resilience |
| Students | Visual understanding of faithfulness and safety concepts |
| PMs / Compliance | Clear trust metrics for sign-off |
| Ops / SREs | Early detection of regressions before rollout |

---

## Metrics of Success
- Percentage of unsafe or unfaithful outputs caught pre-production
- Average time-to-fix evaluation failures (target under 48 hours)
- Human review load reduction via calibrated judges
- Trend improvement in faithfulness and injection-block rate over releases
- Adoption of TrustBench profiles across projects

---

## Long-Term Vision
TrustBench evolves from a testing tool into an AI safety infrastructure layer.
Every agent, model, and pipeline will have a trust score the same way code has
test coverage. Over time, the system learns from every run, building a living
benchmark for trustworthy AI.

## Motto
> Trust is not magic - it is measured.
