# Trust Bench Repository

The streamlined ProjectÂ 2 multi-agent deliverable now lives under **`Project2v2/`**.

To set up or run the workflow, follow the instructions in `Project2v2/README.md`. All legacy artifacts from the original Trust Bench stack remain at the repository root for archival/reference purposes.
