# Milestone 1.1: Report History List - ✅ COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

### Backend API ✅

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/list`
**Location**: `trust_bench_studio/api/server.py` (lines 270-345)

**Features Implemented**:

- Scans all evaluation runs from `trustbench_core/eval/runs/`
- Extracts metadata from each run:
  - Timestamp (from directory name or metadata.json)
  - Repository name/URL (from trace config)
  - Overall verdict (synthesized from pillar scores)
  - Individual pillar scores (Security, Ethics, Fidelity, Performance)
  - HTML report availability check
- Returns sorted list (most recent first via `list_runs()`)
- Handles missing metrics gracefully

**Verdict Logic**:

- **PASS**: All pillars >= 0.7
- **FAIL**: Any pillar < 0.5
- **PARTIAL**: Between PASS and FAIL
- **PENDING**: No pillar scores available

### Frontend Components ✅

#### ReportListItem Component

**Location**: `trust_bench_studio/frontend/components/ReportListItem.tsx`

**Features Implemented**:

- ✅ Verdict icon (✅/❌/⚠️/⏳)
- ✅ Formatted timestamp display
- ✅ Repository name with truncation
- ✅ Color-coded pillar score badges:
  - Green: >= 0.9
  - Yellow: >= 0.7
  - Orange: >= 0.5
  - Red: < 0.5
- ✅ Verdict badge (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL/PENDING)
- ✅ "View Report" button (if HTML report exists)
- ✅ Hover effects for better UX
- ✅ Click handler for viewing reports

#### ReportsPanel Update

**Location**: `trust_bench_studio/frontend/components/App.tsx` (lines 268-370)

**Features Implemented**:

- ✅ Fetches reports on component mount
- ✅ Loading state with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with retry button
- ✅ Empty state message
- ✅ Refresh button in header
- ✅ Report list rendering with ReportListItem
- ✅ Kept MCP cleanup section at bottom
- ✅ Placeholder for report viewer (Milestone 1.2)

### What Works Now

1. Navigate to Reports tab in sidebar
2. See list of all evaluation runs
3. Each report shows:
   - Verdict icon and badge
   - Timestamp and repository
   - All 4 pillar scores (color-coded)
   - "View Report" button (if available)
4. Click refresh to reload list
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Shows helpful empty state

### What's Next (Milestone 1.2)

- [ ] Implement HTML report viewer
- [ ] Add report download button
- [ ] Add baseline comparison view
- [ ] Add MCP activity dashboard

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Backend endpoint returns valid JSON
- [x] Frontend fetches and displays reports
- [x] Verdict logic calculates correctly
- [x] Pillar badges show correct colors
- [x] Timestamps format correctly
- [x] Empty state shows when no reports
- [x] Error state shows on fetch failure
- [x] Loading state shows during fetch
- [ ] Manual test: View multiple reports
- [ ] Manual test: Check different verdict types
- [ ] Manual test: Verify pillar score accuracy

### Known Issues

None currently.

### Performance Notes

- Endpoint scans filesystem on each request
- For 100+ runs, may need pagination
- Consider caching report list in future
